      <h2>Let's set up the sound first</h2>
      <p>The experiment uses the signal from your computer's microphone to interact with the network.</p>
      <p>We take privacy seriously &mdash; the audio itself never leaves your computer.
        The app merely detects when a loud sound occurs.</p>
      <p>The red circle indicator below will blink when a sound is detected.
        Try moving the "Detection" slider, adjusting it so that the indicator only blinks when you speak, or make a noise with your rattle.</p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>In this experiment, our objective is to journey in non-ordinary reality,
        enter the networked space that connects all participants, and perceive what is there.</p>
      <p>You will hear the processes within the network manifested in a sonic accompaniment, based on traditional shamanic drumming.
        If possible, take a rattle or a drum, and play along. The sounds you create will be detected,
        and will have an impact on what's going on inside of the network.</p>
      <p>The experiment is divided into three equally long parts, denoted by three strokes of a bell.
        You do not need to react to these changes, but be mindful of the new section when it begins.</p>
      <p>At the end, you shall hear the traditional callback signal.</p>
