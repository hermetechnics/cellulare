      <h2>Technical set-up</h2>
      <p>You will be able to interact with the network through sound -
        you can use your rattle, voice or a drum. The experiment uses
        the signal from your computer's microphone, so please enable it
        in the pop-up window or in the settings of your browser.</p>
      <p>You should adjust the sensitivity according to the loudness based on
        your set up. Try to make a noise - the red circle indicator below will
        blink when it is detected. Try moving the "Detection" slider, adjusting
        it so that the indicator only blinks when you speak, or make a noise
        with your rattle.</p>
      <form>
        <div id="threshold-indicator"></div>
        <label for="bd-threshold-slider">Detection</label>
        <div id="threshold-setup-wrapper">
          <div>Most sensitive</div>
          <input type="range" min="0" max="0.3" value="0.01" step="0.001" id="bd-threshold-slider" name="bd-threshold-slider" />
          <div>Least sensitive</div>
        </div>
      </form>
      <p>If you have technical problems with the set-up, you can find more
        details on enabling your microphone at the following links:

        <strong>Do not worry if the microphone input isn't working - you can still participate in the experiment without it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>We take privacy seriously &mdash; the audio itself never leaves your computer.
        The app merely detects when a loud sound occurs.</p>
      <p><em>If you experience any technical issues, you can safely refresh the page and rejoin the experiment.</em></p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>In the next screen, you will enter the experiment.</p>
      <p>You will hear the processes within the network manifested in a sonic
        accompaniment, based on traditional shamanic drumming.
        If possible, take a rattle or a drum, and play along. The sounds you
        create will be detected, and will have an impact on what's going on
        inside of the network and what other participants experience.</p>
      <p>You will also see a light circle on the screen. Please do not focus on
        it too much, as it is just reacting to the loudness of your sound. If
        you find it too distracting, feel free to close your eyes.</p>
      <p>
        The experiment is divided into two parts, the transition is marked by
        three strokes of a bell. You do not need to react to these changes, but
        be mindful of the new section when it begins and perceive any difference.</p>
      <p>At the end, you shall hear the traditional callback signal.</p>
